<h1>Princples of Design Assignment</h1>
</br>

<h3>Affordances</h3>
<img src="affordance.png">
<p>The "Tweet" button is styled completely correctly. It allows visitors to understand
that the button is meant to submit their entered text. It is designed for its intended function as it
eliminates the possibilty of user error because it only looks clickable.</p>

<h3>Signal-to-Noise</h3>
<img src="SN.png">
<p>This website makes incredibly good use of its available white space. Leif's website design does a 
good job at eliminating initial claustraphobia when landing on their homepage. Some eCommerce sites
are very bad at doing this and visitors get discourged right when they enter their site because they
either aren't sure how to navigate it or they don't know where to start.</p>

<h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
<img src="thirds.jpg">
<p>Here you can see how Twitter used the Rule of Thirds in the design of their web application. Using 
the rule of thirds which also stays responsive makes the design appealing to its users as well as 
keeping the content on the site easy to navigate.

<h3>Hick's Law</h3>
<img src="hick.png">
<p>Apple has always been known for their simplistic and minimalist design. They really effectively 
demostrate Hick's law in all their products by eliminating additional choices by choosing most of 
the design characteristics for you. When purchasing a Mac they simply lay out the specs for you and 
you pretty much just choose the color you want. They minimaize the choices you must make, therefore you
don't have to take much time when trying to make a decision.</p>

<h3>Ockham's Razor</h3>
<img src="ok.png">
<p>Weebly make's good use of Ockham's Razor Design Princple in the way that they allow it's users to 
simply just choose a templated website that they can essentially stylize theirselves with simple drag
and drop widgets that provide different affordances. It make's a complex website look very simple 
to it's end-user.</p>
